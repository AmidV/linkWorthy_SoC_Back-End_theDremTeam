# Back End for linkWorthy

## Project details:

For our School of Code week-9 project, we created linkWorthy, an app to organise and find a particular link article resources and links categorised by a bootcamp week.
Front end hosted here: https://soc-link-worthy.netlify.app/

This repo contains the code deployed to back end via Heroku which holds the data for weeks and cards of our app.
